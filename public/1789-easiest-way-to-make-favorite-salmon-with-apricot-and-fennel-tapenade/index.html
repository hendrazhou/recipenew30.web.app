<p>Hello everybody, it&rsquo;s me again, Dan, welcome to our recipe site. Today, I will show you a way to make a distinctive dish, salmon with apricot and fennel tapenade. One of my favorites. This time, I am going to make it a bit unique. This will be really delicious.</p>
<p>Salmon With Apricot and Fennel Tapenade is one of the most popular of current trending meals in the world. It&rsquo;s enjoyed by millions every day. It&rsquo;s simple, it&rsquo;s fast, it tastes delicious. Salmon With Apricot and Fennel Tapenade is something that I have loved my entire life. They&rsquo;re nice and they look wonderful.</p>
<p>Top these burgers with a few fennel slices for an extra-bright crunch to balance the richness of the salmon and olives. Finely chop the olives, checking for any pits. The traditional tapenade originated in France and is made with capers, olives, and olive oil but for this recipe, I use. To make everyone excited about this dish, I added a few branches of rosemary to the baking dish.</p>
<p>To get started with this recipe, we must first prepare a few ingredients. You can cook salmon with apricot and fennel tapenade using 25 ingredients and 16 steps. Here is how you cook it.</p>

<script></script>
<h5 id="the-ingredients-needed-to-make-salmon-with-apricot-and-fennel-tapenade">The ingredients needed to make Salmon With Apricot and Fennel Tapenade:</h5>
<ol>
<li>Make ready  For the Fennel Broth</li>
<li>Take  The Greens and Outermost Layer from a Medium Fennel Bulb</li>
<li>Get 1 Liter Water</li>
<li>Make ready  Sea Salt</li>
<li>Take  For the Fish</li>
<li>Prepare 4 Portions De-Boned Salmon Fillets</li>
<li>Take  Approximately 3 Cups of your Fennel Broth</li>
<li>Get 1 Clove Garlic</li>
<li>Take 1/2 of a Chopped Shallot</li>
<li>Prepare 1/8 Tsp Cayenne Powder</li>
<li>Get 1 Tsp Unsalted Butter</li>
<li>Prepare Splash White Wine</li>
<li>Get  Salt</li>
<li>Prepare  Pepper</li>
<li>Prepare  For the Tapenade</li>
<li>Take 1/2 of a Fennel Bulb Chopped</li>
<li>Prepare 8 Dried Apricot Slices</li>
<li>Prepare 3/4 Tbsp Honey Chèvre (Goats Cheese)</li>
<li>Get 9 Skinless and Unsalted Hazelnuts</li>
<li>Prepare 1/2 of a chopped Shallot</li>
<li>Get 2 1/2 Tsp Strong Horseradish</li>
<li>Make ready 1 Tsp Lemon Juice</li>
<li>Get 1 Tbsp Grated Parmesan Cheese</li>

</ol>
<p>Fennel is a staple vegetable around the world and can be found in Mediterranean, Middle Eastern, and Indian cuisines. Top the cauliflower with the cooked salmon and finish with squeeze of lemon. This salmon with fennel baked in parchment is a classic French dish—saumon au fenouil en papillotte. Place a salmon fillet over thinly sliced fennel on parchment paper.</p>

<p>This salmon with fennel baked in parchment is a classic French dish—saumon au fenouil en papillotte. Place a salmon fillet over thinly sliced fennel on parchment paper. Fennel is used several ways to flavor these tender fillets of slow-roasted salmon The seeds are mixed with lime zest and salt to rub all over the fish before cooking, which perfumes it through and through Then a shaved fennel bulb is used two ways, both roasted in the pan beneath the fillets and tossed. Lately, I've been on a quest to create salmon toppings that disguise the fishy flavor. I love salmon and olive tapenade-must be delish!</p>
